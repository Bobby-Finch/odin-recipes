    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A delicious meal the whole family can enjoy, can feed a family of 6. It’s also relatively easy
      to make, thanks to the use of oven-ready lasagna noodles, which will save time and effort
      while delivering a taste similar to fresh homemade pasta. The noodles are layered with a
      flavorful meat sauce, crushed tomatoes, and a mix of creamy ricotta, gooey mozzarella, and
      Parmesan cheese. Baked until nice and golden.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds of ground beef or italian sausage</li>
      <li>16 ounces of mozzarella</li>
      <li>ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>canned crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>tomato sauce</li>
      <li>tomato paste</li>
      <li>eggs</li>
      <li>oven-ready lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>italian seasoning</li>
      <li>onion</li>
      <li>garlic</li>
      <li>olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <h3>Make the sauce</h3>
      <li>
        Begin by heating 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pot over a medium heat, next add your
        meat. Season and cook, stirring occasionally and breaking the meat into small pieces, until
        slightly browned but not cooked all the way through. Next, we add our tomato paste, tomato
        sauce, crushed tomatoes, salt, pepper, and italian seasoning. Bring to a boil then reduce
        the heat and simmer until the sauce thickens, about 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <h3>Make the Cheese Filling</h3>
      <li>
        Combine the ricotta, mozzarella, parmesan, eggs, garlic, salt, italian seasoning, and pepper
        in a bowl and mix until evenly combined.
      </li>
      <h3>Assemble the Lasagna</h3>
      <li>
        Spread some sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Arrange 3 noodles over the sauce, and
        spoon a third of the cheese filling over the noodles and spread. Repeat layering of sauce,
        noodles, cheese filling 2 more times. Finish by sprinkling with the remaining mozzarella and
        parmesan. Cover the lasagna tightly with aluminum foil and bake for 40 minutes in a 375°F
        oven. Remove from the oven and let sit for 10 minutes before serving.
